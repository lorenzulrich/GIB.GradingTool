		<p>The GIB Grading Tool allows project owners to assess their infrastructure project in terms of sustainability and therefore identifies strength and weaknesses of the assessed project. <strong>It provides a quality assessment to de-risk infrastructure projects for investors.</strong></p>

		<p>With the GIB Grading Tool, sustainable infrastructure can be distinguished from non-sustainable infrastructure. It helps to highlight the environmental, social and economic risks and the potential impacts resulting from decisions and gives investors and project owners a framework for decision-making.</p>
